### Text_File_Name_Suggestion

📄 File name suggestion for text files.

#

Make sure to replace "path/to/your/text/files/directory" with the actual path to the directory containing your text files.

This code will walk through the specified directory, find all text files (ending with ".txt"), read their contents, clean the text, and suggest file names based on the first three words in the cleaned text. You can adjust the suggestion logic to better fit your specific use case.
